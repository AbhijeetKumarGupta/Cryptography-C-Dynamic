In this version of Cryptography i tried to make it more difficult to figure out the decryption algo by giving encryption a dynamic approach,
as it generates different encrypted messages of variying length for same message but when decrypted generates the original message. It still
has some bugs on which i am still working. In the Test file there are some encrypted messages of of various lengths which generate same message.
